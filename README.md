# discord-message-server-tag
Script that puts the "server" tag above your message replies in Discord.  

# Disclaimer
This bug/exploit was found by Dropout#1337 (853184720732422154).  

# Usage
- Edit `main.py`, and put your token in the `token` variable.
- Copy the ID of any channel you want to use this in (can't be DM), and paste it where it asks for the channel ID.
- Type anything you want and press enter on the First Message and Second Reply.
- Type anything you want to send to the channel in Message, and it should have the "server" tag above it.

This is quite useless, but fun to play around with as it can confuse some people.
